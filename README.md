# Computer-Connect-Game
Simply made when I was bored. Feels Like connected to a random computer and execute remote commands :)

syntax of program -> python modulename.py -u {username} -p {password(anything)}
another way > python modulename.py --username {username} --password {password (anything) }

You can put any password you like. But if you put a random username it will generate that random username and you are connected to that computer's shell or terminal.

NOTE : all the commands you give to that shell/terminal is executed on your computer and that username is randomly generated(see the code).
also if you put the username of your computer it will be connected to your computer.


I just made when I was bored, this is a python program connected to a random computer(feels like). and the commands you give is similar to giving the commands inside your terminal.

and also some commands like cd won't change directory. If you can modify the script to a better level that's more good.
