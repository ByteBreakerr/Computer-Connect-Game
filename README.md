# Computer-Connect-Game
syntax of program -> python computer.py -u {username} -p {password(anything)}
another way > python computer.py --username {username} --password {password (anything) }

You can put any password you like. But if you put a random username it will generate that random username and you are connected to that computer's shell or terminal.

NOTE : all the commands you give to that shell/terminal is executed on your computer and that username is randomly generated(see the code).
also if you put the username of your computer it will be connected to your computer.

If you can modify the script to a better level that's more good.
